        "    7. T-11 is messy because it gives each day of the month and column and some of these days have two values per day. In T-12 'days' is given as the column header and thereby each date and each value per date has its own row. In 12b it's tidied further because the values are delegated into max and min, allowing for fewer rows.\n",
